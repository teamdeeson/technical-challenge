This is to asses your HTML, CSS and JavaScript abilities.\n\n\nFollowing submission we'll be asking you questions about your approach, choices and what you might have had to learn to complete the assignment in the technical interview.\n\n\nThe times in the challenges below are recommended for a seasoned senior developer. If you're earlier in your career feel free to spend the time required to give a good account of yourself.\n\n\n1. Coding 'out of the box' to an unconventional assignment\n\n\nDownload deeson_posters.zip\n\n\nIn the attached zip file there is a collection of posters, please pick one and reproduce it using just HTML and CSS (no images), it does not need to be responsive, but it should look correct in Chrome, Firefox, IE9, IE10 and IE11.\n\n\nPlease aim to spend only 30 minutes on this task.\n\n\n2. Writing a small Javascript app\n\n\nFor this task you will create a HTML page with a functional stopwatch. The stopwatch will have the following features:\n\n\n\n\nTime display: The current elapsed time in the following format 00:00:00:00 (hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds)\n\n\nStart button: A button to start or continue a timer.\n\n\nPause button: A button to pause the running timer.\n\n\nReset button: A button to reset the timer to zero.\n\n\n\n\nBonus points:\n\n\n\n\nLap button: A button to write the time to a list/table of laps (this would not pause the timer). The results should be shown on screen and still be visible if the page is refreshed.\n\n\nClear lap history button: A button to clear any lap history\n\n\nMake it look good\n\n\nNo bugs or quirky behaviour... (is keeping good time?)\n\n\nAny build tools, instructions or other things you think a good project should include\n\n\n\n\nPlease aim to spend approximately 2 hours on this task.\n\n\nWe are looking for the following\n\n\n\n\nWe will only be testing this in Chrome.\n\n\nThese are intended to give us a feel for how you work as a developer and your level of experience and technical ability.\n\n\nApproach is more important than framework. By all means use your tool of choice but we won't judge.\n\n\n\n\nWhere to send to\n\n\nWhen you are done, please send your completed source code and any covering notes to our Technical Director, Dan James - \ndanj@deeson.co.uk",
